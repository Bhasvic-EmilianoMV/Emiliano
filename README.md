I am a computer science student studying for my A-Levels. I don't particularly have any professional goals at this point in time. I don't know exactly what sector I wish to be in currently, however I am interested in game development right now although I have only scratched the surface of it. I am currently working on a small project of mine which is to try to understand the basics of Unity via attempting to make an adaptation of the game, "Flappy Bird". The only qualification that comes to mind is that I got an 8 in my Computer Science GCSE. In terms of soft skills, I am pretty good at adaptability, teamwork and problem-solving.
